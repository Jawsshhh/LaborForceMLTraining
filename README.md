# LaborForceMLTraining

A machine learning task performed for the partial completion of the course STINTSY at De la Salle University.

This project tackles a multi-class classification problem using the Philippines’ Labor Force Survey (LFS) 2016 dataset. The goal is to predict an individual’s employment status—Employed, Unemployed, or Not in the Labor Force—based on demographic and socioeconomic features.

# Project Workflow
1. Data Understanding & EDA

- Analyzed feature distributions, missing values, and class balance

- Visualized relationships using Matplotlib and Seaborn

2. Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing data and irrelevant columns

- Applied encoding, scaling, and resampling techniques (SMOTENC)

3. Model Development & Evaluation

- Implemented classifiers: KNN, Decision Trees, Neural Networks (PyTorch), SGD

- Optimized hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV

- Evaluated models using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices

4. Key Tools & Libraries

- Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, PyTorch, imbalanced-learn

- Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn
